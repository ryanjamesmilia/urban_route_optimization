This project utilizes the ArcGIS Pro Network Analyst extension to model and optimize delivery routes for a hypothetical 
coffee bean distribution service within downtown Vancouver, BC. The primary objective is to determine the most efficient 
routes for servicing independent cafés, minimizing delivery times and potential operational costs. This analysis addresses 
the logistical challenges present in urban distribution, where route optimization can significantly impact efficiency. By 
employing Network Analyst’s Route workflow, I will evaluate the influence of factors such as traffic patterns and road 
network constraints on delivery performance. Utilizing Business Analyst’s Points of Interest (POI) search, a dataset of 
independent coffee shop locations was compiled to serve as delivery destinations. This study provides a practical framework 
for assessing and improving delivery logistics in a dense urban environment.

Independent cafe locations for downtown Vancouver were sourced from the Business Analyst dataset within the base 
Canada folder of ArcGIS Pro. This dataset provided a comprehensive list of businesses, allowing for the extraction 
of relevant points of interest based on business type, ensuring an accurate representation of cafe locations for the 
route optimization analysis.
