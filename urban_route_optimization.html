    <h1>Urban Route Optimization</h1>
    <p>
        This project utilizes the ArcGIS Pro Network Analyst extension to model 
        and optimize delivery routes for a hypothetical coffee bean distribution 
        service within downtown Vancouver, BC. The primary objective is to determine 
        the most efficient routes for servicing independent cafés, minimizing delivery 
        times and potential operational costs. This analysis addresses the logistical 
        challenges present in urban distribution, where route optimization can 
        significantly impact efficiency. By employing Network Analyst’s Route workflow, 
        I will evaluate the influence of factors such as traffic patterns and road network 
        constraints on delivery performance. Utilizing Business Analyst’s Points of Interest (POI) 
        search, a dataset of independent coffee shop locations was compiled to serve as 
        delivery destinations. This study provides a practical framework for assessing 
        and improving delivery logistics in a dense urban environment.
    </p>
    
    <h2>Data Selection</h2>
    <p>The selection of delivery locations was conducted using the Business Analyst 
        "Points of Interest" (POI) search tool, specifically targeting independent coffee 
        shops within downtown Vancouver. This methodology ensured the dataset accurately 
        reflected the target demographic for the hypothetical distribution service, focusing 
        on local businesses rather than chain establishments. The downtown Vancouver study 
        area was chosen due to its high concentration of potential delivery points and the 
        complexity of its road network, providing a robust environment for route optimization 
        analysis. Initially, the POI search identified 24 locations. However, review of the 
        attribute table revealed that one location, "Good Earth Coffeehouse," was a branch 
        of a larger chain. To maintain the project's focus on independent cafés, this location 
        was excluded. The final dataset contains 23 delivery points. These points represent 
        the destinations for the route optimization scenarios implemented in the Network Analyst 
        Route workflow.
    </p>
        
    <h2>Tasks</h2>
    <p>The analysis is structured into three distinct runs, each designed to evaluate the impact 
        of specific logistical factors on route efficiency:
    </p>
     
    <h3>Run #1 (Baseline Route):</h3>
    <p>Establishes a baseline for route solution, disregarding real-time traffic and sequence optimization. 
        This route provides a point of comparison for subsequent analyses. 
    </p>
    <img src="assets/baseline_route.png" alt="Baseline Route" style="max-width: 100%; height: auto; border: 1px solid #ccc;">
    <h4>Results:</h4>
    <p>The route follows the Object ID sequence for the delivery points. As a result, the route is not efficient. 
        The route travels across downtown Vancouver in a disorganized fashion, with backtracking and an illogical 
        sequence of stops.
    </p>

    <h3>Run #2 (Optimized with Traffic):</h3>
    <p>refines the baseline by incorporating time-dependent traffic considerations and employing an algorithm to 
        find the optimal stop sequence, aiming to minimize travel time during peak hours. The analysis was performed 
        using a 5:00 PM local time setting to simulate rush-hour traffic.
    </p>
    <img src="assets/optimized_route.png" alt="Optimized Route" style="max-width: 100%; height: auto; border: 1px solid #ccc;">
    <h4>Results:</h4>
    <p>Network Analyst optimized the delivery sequence to minimize travel time during rush hour. The route deviates 
        from the baseline route, strategically avoiding heavily congested streets and favoring alternative routes. 
        This optimization produces a more logical order of stops and eliminated backtracking. 
    </p>

    <h3>Run #3 (Barriers & Preserved Stops):</h3>
    <p>In this final scenario, the route is modified to accommodate simulated road closures. Initially, the route 
        was modified to accommodate closures on W Hastings St, Expo Blvd, and Robson St. To create a more significant 
        impact on the route, closures were also added to Pacific St and Denman St. The route is also constrained to 
        start and end at specified locations. Network Analyst optimizes the sequence of the intermediate stops within 
        these constraints. As a result, the route deviates from the optimized route in Run #2, taking alternative paths 
        around the barriers. This demonstrates the model's adaptability to real-world constraints.
    </p>
    <img src="assets/barrier_route.png" alt="Barrier Route" style="max-width: 100%; height: auto; border: 1px solid #ccc;">
    <h4>Results:</h4>
    <p> In the final scenario, the route was adjusted to navigate around the introduced barriers, which restricted access 
        through certain areas. Additionally, the starting and ending locations were fixed, while Network Analyst optimized 
        the sequence of intermediate stops within these constraints. As a result, the route deviated from the optimized path 
        in Run #2, taking alternative roads to bypass the barriers. However, due to the dense road network in downtown Vancouver, 
        the overall impact on the route was minimal.
    </p>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>This project demonstrated the capabilities of ArcGIS Pro’s Network Analyst extension in optimizing delivery 
        routes for a hypothetical coffee bean distribution service in downtown Vancouver. Through the execution of 
        three distinct route analyses, I examined the influence of varying parameters on delivery efficiency. The 
        optimized route in Run #2 significantly improved upon the baseline by eliminating redundant route segments 
        and following a logical order of stops. In Run #3. The introduction of barriers altered the route, but the 
        impact was mitigated by Vancouver’s dense road network. The results of this study highlight the critical 
        role of spatial analysis in optimizing urban logistics. The application of route optimization tools, such 
        as ArcGIS Pro’s Network Analysis, improves delivery efficiency and enhances adaptability in real-world scenarios.
